@ block elements : the elements which occupies the full line space . (eg: <p>,<li>)

@ inline elements : the elements which occupies only the space upto its length . (eg: <strong>,<em>)

@ id's are not repeated. every tag has a different id but can have various classes. multiple tags can have simmilar class.

@ id represent's the name.

@ Entities = some characters are reserved in HTML so, we use entities to print that characters. eg: <,> .

               @  &lt; = <
               @  &gt; = >
               @ &nbsp; = non breakable space.(use to give space in output because HTML by default chop's all the spaces.)

@ semanctic tags = html provide some tags which are used to define the particular part of a website. eg:<header>,<nav> etc.



HTML contains two (2) main parts:
     
   * tags

   * attributes

   *attributes modify tags
